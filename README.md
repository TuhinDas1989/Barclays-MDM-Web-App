Implement a TODO application using

1.	Single Page application using  React + Typescript - Preferable 
2.	OrASP.NET core + razor view if you don’t know any client framework
3.	Asp.NET core as server side api
4.	Just in Memory collection as database.

The application should support:

1.	List existing tasks
2.	Add and Edit tasks
3.	Deletion of completed tasks only

Validation:

1.	Every task has a name, priority, and status (not started, in progress, completed)
2.	Every task must have a name 
3.	You should validate that we don't have two tasks with the same name 
4.	Priority is a number.  
5.	Business may ask more validation in the future.

Validation must be done at both client and server sides.

Testing

Make sure you have valid unit tests.
